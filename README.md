### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
In my day job, I primarily write ruby. For personal use, I'm likely building small apps with react or writing scripts with python, or ruby of course.

I want to build an app or utility that would be useful for someone in their day to day life. Alas, I've started way too many side projects than I've ended.

I write at https://srvr.in - but not always necessarily about software.
